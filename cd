NAME
       cd — change the working directory

SYNOPSIS
       cd [−L|−P] [directory]

       cd −

DESCRIPTION
       The  cd  utility  shall  change  the working directory of the current shell execution environment (see Section
       2.12, Shell Execution Environment) by executing the following steps in sequence. (In the following steps,  the
       symbol  curpath represents an intermediate value used to simplify the description of the algorithm used by cd.
       There is no requirement that curpath be made visible to the application.)

        1. If no directory operand is given and the HOME environment variable is empty or undefined, the default  be‐
           havior is implementation-defined and no further steps shall be taken.

        2. If  no  directory  operand  is given and the HOME environment variable is set to a non-empty value, the cd
           utility shall behave as if the directory named in the HOME environment variable was specified as  the  di‐
           rectory operand.
